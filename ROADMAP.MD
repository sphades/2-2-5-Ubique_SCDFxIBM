Ubique currently:
Gathers temperature, humidity, and camera data and sends that data to the IBM Cloud for processing
Processes the data through a node-red, using visual recognition service and IoT Watson
Visualizes basic data through a dashboard
Send alerts for fire incidences through Trello, a text messaging service.
Within the next months we are aiming to do:
Build a minimum viable product
Collect more data to train machine learning algorithm
Train Custom machine learning algorithm to advise emergency services on other types of emergency incidence
Create more capability in the dashboard to monitor larger sets of real-time data
 
Longer term goals are:
Support as many types of IoT devices as possible
Connect to the Open Digital Platform to harness the information to make better predictions
Implement low level artificial intelligence to make educated decisions on appropriate measures for situation
