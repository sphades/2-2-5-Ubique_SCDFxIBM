# Roadmap

![Roadmap](/assets/roadmap/timeline.png)

## Ubique currently:
* Gathers temperature, humidity, and camera data from an IoT sensor and sends that data to the IBM Cloud for processing
* Processes the data through Node-RED, using IBM Watson's Visual Recognition Service
* Visualizes basic data through a dashboard
* Send alerts for fire incidences through Twilio, a text messaging service.

## Within the next few months we are aiming to do:
* Set up a machine learning/deep learning algorithm 
* Collect more data to train the machine learning algorithm
* Train custom machine learning algorithm on a greater variety of emergencies
* Expand upon dashboard/modify dashboard for the monitoring of real-time data
 
## Long term goals are to:
* Improve compatibility with IoT devices
* Connect to the Open Digital Platform to harness more information, making better predictions
* Implement decision optimization to make appropriate decisions given an emergency
